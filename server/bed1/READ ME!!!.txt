Hello :D
This is ThePikaChuP.
Before you install the map please install all the mods and the lucky block addon
To change all the blocks used in the generators please change the id's for the commands in the blocks under the main spawn area.
You can use this map however please not that I did not create this map, I also did not create any mods in this map.
I only created the commands and main spawn area the rest of the building was done by hypixel.

This map was UPDATED for 1.12.2 however it will work upto 1.16.5
If you encounted any errors email themodreviewer6@gmail.com

For those downloading the map on curse the REQUIRED mods are:

(SEE Mod Links.txt)

PLEASE NOTE: 
 for the unchanged version of this map you need all the required mods in 1.12.2 and the lucky block night addon for everything to work
 you can change everything in the commands to change the generation of lucky blocks under the base. There is a button to teleport there at spawn.
